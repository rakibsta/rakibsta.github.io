Why do our opinions need to be heard? Why do we want to be remembered? Why do we do what we do? Everyone has their own answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never been one to put myself out there publicly. A lot of my peers do think I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of an open book sometimes in public, but something about releasing myself for the whole world to see feels incredibly strange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still pinning down my why, but I started this page because the process of learning about the world and growing as a person never stops, and I want to share some of the things I learn for those who may be interested. I&amp;rsquo;ve found in my life that, in most cases, the benefits of collaboration, sharing knowledge, and generally being a nice person far outweigh the potential drawbacks. Hopefully being more &amp;ldquo;out there&amp;rdquo; will keep me accountable in the things I pursue.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>First post</title><link>https://rakibsta.com/posts/placeholder-text/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rakibsta.com/posts/placeholder-text/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;All the cool kids got blogs. I started this page because I want to keep learning more about cool topics and document the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
