Why do we want to be seen? Why do our opinions need to be heard? Why do we want to be remembered? Why do we do what we do? Everyone has their own answers.

I have never been one to put myself out there publicly. A lot of my peers do think I'm a bit of an open book sometimes, but something about releasing myself on the internet for the whole world to see feels incredibly strange.

I'm still pinning down my why, but I started this page because the process of learning about the world and growing as a person never stops, and I want to share some of the things I learn for those who may be interested. I've found in my life that, in most cases, the benefits of collaboration, sharing knowledge, and generally being a nice person far outweigh the potential drawbacks. Hopefully being more "out there" will keep me accountable in the things I pursue.
